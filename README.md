# makigame

### makigame.py

One of, if not my very first program written in Python. The original version only worked on Windows.

A console game that uses ASCII art for visualization. Includes a menu with instructions and the ability to pause. Uses `msvcrt.kbhit()` and `msvcrt.getch()` for non-blocking interaction.

The player moves a spaceship to avoid incoming asteroids. The goal is to survive as long as possible.

### pygame-taste.py

A simple experiment to draw a bouncing ball image using `pygame`.
